This repository contains the OSCAR code used for the computational work supporting my bachelor thesis: **Programming with OSCAR**.

## Repository Contents

The following three Jupyter Notebooks ('.ipynb' files) are included:

|**'Addition_law.ipynb'**| Implemented Group Law on an Elliptic Curve |
|**'WNF.ipynb'**| From a general homogeneous polynomial to a Weierstrass Normal Form |
|**'Quadrics.ipynb'**| From two quadric surfaces in P^3 to a Weierstrass Normal Form in P^2 |

### Requirements

To execute and interact with these notebooks, you must have Julia and OSCAR installed.
